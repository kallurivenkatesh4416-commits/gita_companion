5) SCREEN FLOW (USER JOURNEY)

First launch:
- Onboarding -> language/guidance/privacy/notifications preferences -> Home.

Daily use (ideal happy path):
- Open Home -> read Daily Verse -> tap "Start Today (60 sec)" ->
  pick mood -> view verse -> get one actionable guidance step -> optional reflection -> mark done.

Exploration paths:
- Home -> Chapters -> Verse Detail -> Ask about this verse in Chat.
- Home -> Mood check-in -> guidance + verse references.
- Home -> Journal/Favorites/Collections/Journeys for continuity.

Chat flow:
- User asks question -> assistant streams response progressively ->
  final response shows verification badge + details + verse provenance.
- User can stop generation mid-stream.
- If streaming fails, app falls back to regular non-stream `/chat`.

Offline flow:
- Home/Chapters show offline notices.
- Verse browsing still works from cached/bundled content.
- Local features (journal/bookmarks/collections/past chats) remain usable.
- AI chat send is disabled with friendly message while offline.


6) TECH SNAPSHOT (FOR BRAINSTORM CONTEXT)
- Frontend: Flutter + Provider, centralized `AppState`.
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy.
- DB: PostgreSQL (Docker compose, optional pgvector usage in retrieval stack).
- Local persistence: SharedPreferences for onboarding/config/history/journal/ritual state.
- Retrieval/grounding: verse-based, with verification metadata returned to client.


7) WHAT ALREADY FEELS STRONG
- Clear daily anchor (Daily Verse + ritual CTA).
- Good balance of spiritual tone + practical action.
- Multi-language baseline support.
- Offline graceful handling for core non-AI use cases.
- Verification/provenance transparency in AI responses.


8) AREAS TO IMPROVE (HIGH-IMPACT IDEATION TOPICS)
- Home simplification:
  - What should be visible vs collapsible by default?
- Ritual retention:
  - How to improve completion rate without adding pressure?
- Chat depth:
  - Better short/long response modes, follow-up prompts, context carryover.
- Personalization:
  - Smarter suggestions based on mood patterns and recent reflections.
- Accessibility:
  - Font scaling, color contrast variants, one-hand ergonomics.
- Notification quality:
  - Better reminder timing intelligence and opt-down controls.
- Insight loops:
  - Weekly reflection summaries from local journal/mood trends.
- Trust and grounding:
  - Better provenance UI comprehension for non-technical users.
